# Hi, I'm Greg 👋

I am a test automation lead supporting a department of about 200, with a background in DevOps, although I'm a software tester at heart. 🍁🏳️‍🌈

While most of my programming work isn't public, you may find a few tidbits here like a list of [testing tools 🛠️](https://github.com/gpaciga/testing-tools) that I use and a simple [demonstration of mutation testing 👾](https://github.com/gpaciga/mutation-testing-demo). Everything else is hobby work.

You can learn more about me at [gerg.dev](https://gerg.dev). (Yes, that's G-**E**-R-G, not G-**R**-E-G. I can't test _everything_ before I commit.)
