# Hi, I'm Greg 👋

I am a Lead Developer for DevOps and CI/CD supporting a department of about 200, although I'm a software tester at heart. 🍁🏳️‍🌈

While most of my programming work isn't on public, you may find a few tidbits here like a list of [testing tools](https://github.com/gpaciga/testing-tools) that I use and a simple [demonstration of mutation testing](https://github.com/gpaciga/mutation-testing-demo). Everything else is hobby work.

You can learn more about me on twitter as [@GregPaciga](https://twitter.com/gregpaciga) and find my thoughts on testing specifically over at [gerg.dev](https://gerg.dev). (Yes, that's G-E-R-G, not G-R-E-G. I can't test _everything_ before I commit.)

Oh, and for those wondering, that's the [orion nebula](https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap191030.html). I was an astrophysicist in a previous life. 🌟🌌
